## Scenario Planning
## 
## The following is a draft of initial scenario runs to be considered 

#### First evaluation project
**Objective:** Evaluate and compare the performance of SPFI and ROM.  Check if the SPFI and ROM appropriately reflect the exploitation rate. 

**Reasoning:** The Evaluation of SPFI and ROM do not require ERA output and therefore seems to be the perfect candidate for the initial use of the DGM.
